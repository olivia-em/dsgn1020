        The Tower acknowledges that sudden change can feel like both upheaval
        and revelation. Make sure your ambitions are not based on fickle
        desires. Making a leap can be scary, but sometimes you just have to do
        without thinking.

      <div class="desc2">
        The Wheel of Fortune represents cycles, decisive moments, and unexpected
        events. Your change may not feel good, but remember that time will make
        it better. Similarly, don’t get too comfortable in where you’re at,
        you’re bound to move on. You can’t remain at the same place on the
        wheel, you’ll cycle through the good and bad more times than you can
        count.

      <div class="desc3">
        Death can be intimidating or seem like a bad omen, but it’s more often
        about rebirth and transition than anything else. Remember you can think
        back on things fondly while still letting go and moving on. The change
        you’re experience may feel inescapable and even painful, but it brings
        new opportunities and advantages.
